# Gaps In Care 
SQL to MongoDB Schema recommendation walkthrough

Whatâ€™s can be improved with this schema (from a MongoDB or modern modeling lens)?
ðŸš« Over-flattened structure
Everything is a top-level string column â€” even nested, related concepts like:

Lab results
Rules and recommendations
Gaps and sub-gaps

Encounters
ðŸš« Implied relationships, not explicit
Things like RULE_ID, SUB_GAP_ID, CLI_SK, GAP_ID suggest foreign key behavior, but thatâ€™s lost in this format.

It becomes hard to do flexible queries across related concepts or histories without joining 100+ columns.

ðŸš« Opaque column names
SPRS, SPRS_CD, TTL_PROB, YOSâ€¦ you need a glossary just to write a query.
Makes semantic search and intelligent filtering almost impossible.

ðŸš« Homogenized typing
Everything is a StringType() â€” even dates, flags, numerics.
Suggests the data probably came through a Spark pipeline or was ingested without enforced typing.

MongoDB lets you represent the business objects as actual documents, not as 150+ disconnected fields. For example:

``` javascipt
{
  "memberId": "MBR_001",
  "gender": "F",
  "age": 67,
  "globalMemberId": "GLB_001",
  "hicNumber": "HIC_12345",

  "gap": {
    "gapId": "GAP123",
    "description": "No follow-up after abnormal A1C",
    "status": "Open",
    "source": "CDI",
    "reason": "Patient did not schedule follow-up",
    "statusChangeReason": "Contact attempt failed",
    "category": "Chronic Condition",
    "keywords": ["A1C", "follow-up"],
    "rank": 1,
    "likelihood": "High",

    "subGaps": [
      {
        "subGapId": "SUBGAP_1",
        "reason": "Lab flagged as abnormal",
        "rank": 1,
        "status": "Pending"
      }
    ],

    "suppression": {
      "isSuppressed": true,
      "code": "OPT_OUT",
      "reason": "Member opted out",
      "source": "System",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z"
    }
  },

  "lab": {
    "dateOfService": "2024-11-15",
    "loincCode": "4548-4",
    "testType": "Hemoglobin A1C",
    "result": "9.2"
  },

  "recommendation": {
    "source": "RulesEngine",
    "type": "Follow-up Appointment",
    "text": "Schedule visit with endocrinologist",
    "value": "High Priority"
  },

  "rules": {
    "ruleId": "R123",

    "parentRuleId": "PR001",
    "shortName": "A1C Follow-Up",

Why This MongoDB Schema Works Better?

| Field                          | Index Type | Use Case                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| `memberId`, `gap.status`       | Compound   | Fetch open gaps per member   |
| `gap.suppression.isSuppressed` | Single     | Filter suppressed vs. active |
| `lab.loincCode`, `lab.result`  | Compound   | Labs-based triggering        |
| `engine.runId`                 | Single     | Track gaps generated by run  |
| `gap.subGaps.subGapId`         | Multikey   | Nested sub-gap filtering     |
